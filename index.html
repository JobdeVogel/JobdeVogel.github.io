                            <p>My name is Job, I am 24 year young, living in Delft, the Netherlands. Since 2016 I have been studying to become a <b style='font-size: 1.2em'>Building Engineer</b>. Within the building environment, I belief there still is a lot of potential to implement complex state-of-the-art techniques, like big data, Artificial Intelligence, evaluation and optimization to solve social problems and increase sustainability.<br><br>
                                
                                In the future, I hope to become an engineer that makes a <b style='font-size: 1.2em'>difference</b>. By using the skills and talents that have been given to me, I am striving to become someone that makes this world a happier place for everyone.<br><br>
                                In my free time outside of studying, I enjoy making music (playing the saxophone and piano), skating, spending time with friends, discussing higher life questions, and sometimes work on <b style='font-size: 1.2em'>ridiculously stupid projects</b> that take way too much time, but always give people a smile on their faces.<br><br>
                                As <b style='font-size: 1.2em'>Christian</b>, I am a follower of Jesus Christ. I belief we have a father in heaven who cares about us and loves us. He gave us a mission to take care of this world, and although we may fail doing that again and again, we can always come back to him.<br><br>
                                In holidays, I love to spend time doing <b style='font-size: 1.2em'>voluntary work</b> on campings and in the neighborhood, spending time with children sporting and playing, challenging them to think deeper about life and their convictions, and telling them about my own. In autumn 2021, I have been team member of the Student Alpha Team in Delft.<br><br>

                            <p>Since early 2021, I started developing animations and realistic rendering scenes for both educational and personal purposes. For the Master course Beyond3D I created an imaginary post-apocalyptic world, inspired by the .movie Wall-E from Pixar Animation Studios. Nature has been overtaken by garbage, and some of the garbage elements have turned into a small robot, which is trying to cut down all the nature that is left.<br><br>
                                This design has been made using Autodesk Maya, Arnold render engine, Substance Painter, Materialize Bounding Box Software and Adobe Photoshop. Using Maya instance procedures, it was possible to generate large amount of apparent random garbage, with incredible amounts of polygons. The final render took about 5.5 render hours to complete on a modern PC.<br><br>

                            <h1>Hex World</h1>
                            
                            <p>One of the main challenges of the COVID-19 lockdown for students in the Netherlands, was sitting behind a desk at home all day long. Corona makes our world smaller, but by sporting outside we can experience the world as a greater and more beautiful place. In this project, we created a planet creation visualization within a McNeel Rhino environment, that stimulates sporting in the physical world.<br><br>
                                By using the Strava (sport app) API, it was possible to collect live geographical data and numerical data about our sporting activities and converted the data to a 2D map in Rhino using Python and Grasshopper. Next, this 2D data was mapped to a sphere. By developing a recursive algorithm in Python, I was able to create a 3D terrain that indicates the intensity of activities. Smaller objects on the sphere, like bonfires and trees, indicate special achievements, like breaking a record.<br><br>
                                In theory, this project could be converted to a real app that people use on their phone to track there sporting activities. Unfortunately, this was outside the scope of the project.

                            <p>For this project we used several methods and techniques. Personally, I was responsible for guiding the team, because of my prior knowledge in (visual) programming. My main personal contributions are mentioned in the previous paragraph. Other teammates focused on converting our digital model to a fabrication model using Robots, and outputting the data using Arduino. Our project was graded with a 10/10.<br><br>
                                To visualize this project, we used McNeel Rhino as main interface. The data was collected using IronPython (expecially webscraping libraries). Using the PyFirmata Python 3 package I helped my teammates to convert the output to a physical Arduino output. The video on the left is a visualization of the recursive mountainization algorithm.<br><br>

                            <p>The minor Spatial Computing was my first experience with real optimization based on shortest-path algorithms, dynamic space agents and linear algebra. Our assignment was based on an existing building block in the city center of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. By generating a voxel cloud and analyzing numerical values like sunlight, noise and a program of requirements, we were able to generate a building based on ideal positions for each function.<br><br>
                                For this project, we used Houdini and the programming language SideFX, C++ and Python. Within the group, I was responsible for the dynamic placement of the program functions. After completing this minor, I rebuilt the A-start path finding algorithm to a Grasshopper implementation, to use in future projects. The final renders were made using Rhino and Lumion.<br><br>

                            <p>After finishing the Computational Design course for my Master Building Technology, I was asked to develop an API to create Robot programs through Rhino and Grasshopper, as extracurricular activity.<br><br>
                                By using the RoboDK API, Python and Grasshopper, a brick design in Rhino can be converted to CSV. Next this CSV data is interpreted by the RoboDK software and automatically builds a program that can be executed on a real robot arm.<br><br>
                                Since I built this project for a course that would be given later in 2022 to other students, one of the main challenges was making this project clear, structured and as readable as possible. The complete project is available on my GitHub page.<br><br>

                            <h1>A* Algorithm</h1>

                            <p>A* is a well-known path finding algorithm, known for its highly efficient method to find the shortest distance in a graph. After finishing my minor Spatial Computing, in which we were introduced to A*, I wanted to experiment with this algorithm using primarily Python and Grasshopper.<br><br>
                                Within several weeks of part-time work, I was able to develop a Grasshopper script that could utilize the A* algorithm to find shortest Euclidian paths in a building. One of the main challenges was the fact that Python 3 was not available yet for Grasshopper at that time, so I only had access to Python 2 libraries. This project was my first experience in parallel computing. During this project I really got to know the limits of computational design within Grasshopper, which gave me reason to consider alternative software for these types of projects.<br><br>

                            <p>Sometimes you just have the perfect idea for one of the most stupid projects possible. Living together with 8 housemates, I sometimes get a headache of all the 'welcome home' callings from my housemates in our hall. Therefore I decided to build my own 'compliments-generator'.<br><br>
                                The 'compliments-generator' is able to register housemates coming home, and gives them a welcome message through a screen and speakers. This welcome message is recorded by another housemate on a phone.<br><br>
                                By using an old laptop, Arduino and a lot of Python, I was able to build this generator.<br><br>

                            <h1>CIRCULARITY</h1>
                            
                            <p>As final Bachelor of Architecture project, I was asked to develop an integrated design for a sporting school in Rotterdam. Although there was little space for personal choice in location or building type, I was allowed to decide to fully focus this project on circularity.<br><br>
                                Circularity is an abstract term that needs a very specific definition before implemented. By first analyzing the concept and then trying to implement it in my design, I was able to reach for the limitation of circularity.<br><br>
                                For this project I used McNeel Rhino as main design tool. The construction of this project was modelled parametrically in Grasshopper. Details of the building construction were made using Rhino, Illustrator and Photoshop. The renders visible on the posters are created using Google Earth, Lumion and Photoshop.<br><br>
                                Although I have decided to focus my Master on Building Technology, and therefore not so much on architectural design, I think this project is a good representation of some of the design skill I have gained over the years.<br><br>

                            <p>Combining different types of people in one building project can be difficult, especially in renovation projects. In my second year of my Bachelor of Architecture, I re-designed a building block in Amsterdam.<br><br>
                                After finishing this project, I decided to spend one year on working for the student board of 'Stichting Herontwikkeling tot Studentenhuisvesting'. Within this year, I really leaned the ins and outs of designing and especially managing buildings with diverse groups of people living in it.<br><br>
                                This project is my best example of working in Autodesk Revit. I completely built this project in 3D first in Revit and afterwards used Photoshop to give it an artistic interpretation.<br><br>

                                    <p>Rhino is my primary software tool to design in 2D and 3D digitally. Usually I combine the use of Rhino with Grasshopper and render software like Lumion or Enscape. I especially like the use of Rhino because of the versatility to use it in combination with other programs.<br>I have had personal experience in Rhino by using it for many study projects, and personal projects, but I have also tutored Rhino to first year bachelor students of Architecture as Teaching Assistant Design Informatics.</p>

                                    <p>In the last five years I spent many hours in Grasshopper. I have developed several projects and tools within Grasshopper, using the visual nodes, or standard Python programming. Furthermore, I have tutored and lectured Grasshopper to bachelor students and developed a new GH study program for TU Delft. You can find this study program in the link down below. I am familiar with most functions and the background principles of Grasshopper. Since it is not possible to work in Grasshopper all the time, I try to stay up-to-date through the McNeel forum. In the future I hope to research alternative parametric modelling software like Maya or Unity as alternative to Grasshopper, specifically to be able to handle and process more data than possible in Grasshopper.</p>

                                    <p>Since late 2020 Python became my main programming language to use for design and programming projects. Since then, I spent several hours in Python a week on average, but in certain periods it can take all my working time. I'm am familiar with libraries like Numpy, Pygame, Pyfirmata and more. Specifically interesting Python projects were my API connection between Grasshopper and RoboDK and the 'Welcome Home' generator I developed for a personal project. Currently, I am slowly trying to switch to other programming languages like C# and JavaScript, to be able to work in more different environments.</p>

                                    <p>Before the summer of 2021, I followed a master course called Beyond 3D which focused on creating an imaginary world within Maya; professionaly one of the most used 3D animation software. After finishing this project, I spent approximately 6 fulltime weeks on a volutary mission to recreate the 20th Century Fox animation for my Student Association. This taught me throughoutly how to use Maya as animation and the Arnold engine as render tool. In the future I hope to be able to learn Blender, since this is an alternative software which is available for free.</p>

                                    <p>In combination with Maya I used Substance Painter to enhance the visuals of my renders. Since this is quite a straightforward software, as long as you are able to generate correct texture maps, I placed this software in the 'experienced' category.</p>

                                    <p>Autodesk Revit is one of the most used BIM tools in the built environment. Since the beginning of my Architecture studies, I have been working with the software. However, in my daily design process, I try to avoid the use of Revit as much as possible. In my experience Revit limits my creativity because of the expertise that is required to create complex shapes and geometries. Therefore, I usually make my 2d drawing in Rhino, although I am able to make them in Revit.</p>

Unfortunately, Lumion requires extremely fast hardware to run, so I only use it when I really want to make a perfect image.</p>

During my studies however, I have not used Enscape that much. Considering my experience in Lumion, I think switching to Enscape is just a small step.</p>

However, since it is almost impossible to avoid Illustrator when making vector drawings, I have learned to use it in special cases. Especially in my export process of making 2D construction and building plans, I think it is very useful.</p>

                                    <p>Since early 2021 I started using RoboDK to control Robot arms for my projects. Although I do not have a lot of experience in controlling robots in real-life, I did spend a lot of time in the RoboDK software. As extracurriculair assignment to my standard courses, I was asked to develop a Grasshopper-RoboDK interaction script to create brick designs with a robot arm.
